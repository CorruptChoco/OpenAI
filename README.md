# OpenAI

Just wanted to put up the code I used to generate images using OpenAI a while back. I used it to make player pictures for my D&D games.
the "fun" file generates images based of prompt.
the "variations" file takes an image and generates similar images.

NOTE: i wrote this back when OpenAI was brand new and there weren't a lot of options for image generation like there are today.
